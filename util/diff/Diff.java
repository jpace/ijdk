/**
 * Compares two collections, returning a list of the additions, changes, and
 * deletions between them. A <code>Comparator</code> may be passed as an
 * argument to the constructor, and will thus be used. If not provided, the
 * initial value in the <code>a</code> ("from") collection will be looked at to
 * see if it supports the <code>Comparable</code> interface. If so, its
 * <code>equals</code> and <code>compareTo</code> methods will be invoked on the
 * instances in the "from" and "to" collections; otherwise, for speed, hash
 * codes from the objects will be used instead for comparison.
 *
 * <p>The file FileDiff.java shows an example usage of this class, in an
 * application similar to the Unix "diff" program.</p>
